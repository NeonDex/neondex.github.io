<p>We discovered Signature Chogcolate Supreme. The cake was so delicious I had to ask where they got it from. The cakes themselves are so fresh and moist, unlike any I’ve ever had. The frosting is perfect and unique, not too sweet. I’ve also tried their cake balls which are delicious too! I can’t wait for our next party so I can have more cake.</p>

	<p>Their cupcakes are probably the best I’ve ever had. They are so moist and the frostings are amazing. Even my hard to please fiancé thought they were amazing. I truly can’t say enough good things. I’m so glad that I found this shop!</p>

<p>We celebrate monthly birthdays at work. This was the first time I ordered from patty’s cakes and this is the first time 30 employees did not complain. We ordered a Chocolate Lava Cake with bavarian cream filling. It was amazing!!!! Decorations were also amazing – had a bit of glitter which I loved! I will most definitely order again!!! I also ordered the cake balls which were yummy!</p>

<p>Wonderful experience and a tasty tasty cake to boot! My husband and I walked into our cake tasting with the expectation this would be picking out just any cake. We are not sweet eaters in the slightest, but once we tasted the quality of Patty’s Cakes we were stoked! Hands down the best cake and experience we could have asked for.</p>
